# Dynamic_TicTacToe
A Dynamic TicTacToe game with opponent using Java, A Test from FWD Insurance.

There's a few things I added to this game : 
1. Dynamic game, so you can play using 3x3 or 4x4 board depends on what the user want
2. A Computer opponent, so you can play with yourself againts computer
3. some basic feature to make it felt nicer to play 

Thanks for your Attention, Hopefully you like the game !
Cheers !
